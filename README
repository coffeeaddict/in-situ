In-situ
=======

In-situ (or in-place) editing for objects that have attributes
(Like ActiveRecord objects).


Example
=======

Example goes here.


Todo
=====
* Put up an example there...
* Create observers so that I need not render a span for every in-situ
  attribute, but am able to use h1, h2, etc.
* Use Rails.cache somehow to store the options of the in-situ assignment and
  carry them over to the form, the re-display and the cancel.
* Figure out how I18n blends in to all this
